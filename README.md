# LincolNLP
Natural Language Processing on our 16th President


This project is still in its infancy. So far, all of the data has been mined, and is being hosted in an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database.

There are many different aspects to this project, but some early goals are tracking sentiment analysis over time, examining unique words from Lincoln's writing, and potentially creating a Lincoln Language Generator.
